# Emotion  Detection

This is an implementation of the paper Using Deep and Convolutional Neural Networks for
Accurate Emotion Classification on DEAP Dataset(https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0be8/156073a1a586badb88a93f453915ca5e927a.pdf) in Pytorch. The dataset used in this implementation is DEAP(https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/). Currently the server hosting the dataset is unavailable.
